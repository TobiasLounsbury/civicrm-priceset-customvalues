# civicrm-priceset-logic

This extension allows an administrator to set up complex pricing logic for contribution pages that include price-sets.


## Known Issues
- It currently only supports contribution pages, though I am working to add event registrations
- It does not currently support fields in the auto-included billing contact information block
- Custom fields in profiles are only partially supported
- The admin interface has some issues when fields no longer exist in the profile but do in the config.
